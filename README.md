# Heart_Disease_Prediction
A Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person is prone to a heart disease built using Rapid Miner
DATASET DESCRIPTION:
The data set is publicly available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The data set provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors. Each feature explains the following:
Demographic:
Sex: male or female (Nominal)
Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous — Although the recorded ages have been truncated
to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)
Education: no further information provided
Behavioral:
Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal)
Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)
  Information on medical history:
BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)
Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)
Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)
Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)
 Information on current medical condition:
Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)
Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)
Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)
BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)
Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous — In medical research, variables such as heart rate
though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible
values.)
Glucose: blood glucose level (Continuous)
Target Variable to Predict:
10 Year Risk of coronary Heart Disease (CHD) - (Binary:  “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)
